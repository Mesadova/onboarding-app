# Onboarding digital (React)

## üìÑ Description

This repository contains a **digital onboarding app** based on sliding cards using React framework. The application is modular and may serve as a template with a non-fixed number of cards and information. For each object values of an array, it creates a series of sliding cards with keys title, description, background color and image. The app provides a two-way sliding navigation: via buttons (one card at a time, `RenderButtons.jsx`) and global position (access any card in the app, `Indicator.jsx`).
